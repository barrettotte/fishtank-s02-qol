## Install

Install with TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey, or similar userscript browser add-on using `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barrettotte/fishtank-s02-qol/master/fishtank-s02-qol.js`

## Note

I couldn't figure out how to interact directly with the webpacked app that Fishtank uses.
So, I went for a little hacky approach of auto-clicking, so there's an extra sound that plays when swapping cameras.
