Adds some quality of life features for [Fishtank season 2](https://www.fishtank.live/) site that I wanted.

- Collapsible panels on left side by clicking title
- Fishtank-related quick link buttons on left side
  - Open `#fishtanklive` on X in new tab
  - Open `/tv/` in new tab
  - Open [fishtank.guru](https://fishtank.guru/), a site with all crafting recipes

## Install

Install with TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey, or similar userscript browser add-on using `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barrettotte/fishtank-s02-qol/master/fishtank-s02-qol.js`

## Note

I couldn't figure out how to interact directly with the webpacked app that Fishtank uses.
So, I went for a little hacky approach of auto-clicking, so there's an extra sound that plays when swapping cameras.
